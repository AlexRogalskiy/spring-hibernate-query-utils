<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While investigation the performance problem in my SpringBoot application, I discovered the infamous N+1 queries problem (more details on this problem [here](https://medium.com/@mansoor_ali/hibernate-n-1-queries-problem-8a926b69f618)) that was killing the performance of my services.

After managing to fix this problem, I had to find a way to detect it and raise the alarm to anoid any new service with this problem.

That is why I created Spring Hibernate Query Count to provide an easy way of counting the queries generated in a Spring application using Hibernate.

If you develop Spring applications using Hibernate, you have probably also encountered performance issues caused by n+1 queries.

This library provides several benefits:

* Counting the exact number of queries generated for each service or resource
* Detecting the n+1 queries problem in your Spring tests and raise the alarm before having performance issues in production
* Avoiding performance regressions by adding an assert on the query count in your integration tests
* Improving the onboarding of new developers by showing them the impact of the n+1 queries problem
* Improve the debugging by seeing which query is executed and when



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* JDK 8 or more.  

### Installation
##### Maven

Add dependency to your project inside your `pom.xml` file
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yannbriancon</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-hibernate-query-count</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```


<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

Now that you added the dependency, you can instantiate a HibernateQueryCountInterceptor object and start to use it.

Three methods are available:
* startCounter: Initializes the query count to 0 and allows the queries to increment the count.
* getQueryCount: Returns the current query count for the Thread concerned as a Long.
* removeCounter: Removes the instance of the queryCount that is a ThreadLocal<Long> and stops the counting.

The count is local to a Thread. This choice was made to have a consistent count for a running application and avoid other threads to alter the count.

Example in a test:

```java
...
import com.yannbriancon.interceptor.HibernateQueryCountInterceptor;


@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@Transactional
public class NotificationResourceIntTest {
    @Autowired
    private HibernateQueryCountInterceptor hibernateQueryCountInterceptor;

    @Test
    public void saveFile_isOk() throws Exception {
        // Initialize the query to 0 and allow the counting
        hibernateQueryCountInterceptor.startCounter();

        // Call the resource that we want to test
        MvcResult result = mvc.perform(get("/rest/notifications"))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andReturn();

        // Get the query count for this thread and check that it is equal to the number of query you expect, let's say 4.
        // The count is checked and we detect potential n+1 queries.
        Assertions.assertThat(hibernateQueryCountInterceptor.getQueryCount()).isEqualTo(4);
    }
}
```
