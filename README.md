<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
    
Spring Hibernate Query Count provides an easy way of counting the queries generated in a Spring application using 
Hibernate. The library allows you to count exact number of queries generated in each thread.

If you develop Spring applications using Hibernate, you have probably already encountered performance issues caused by n+1 queries.

The infamous n+1 queries problem is hard to detect because the queries are generated by Hibernate, see more detail on this problem [here](https://medium.com/@mansoor_ali/hibernate-n-1-queries-problem-8a926b69f618).

This library provides several benefits:

* Counting the exact number of queries generated for each service or resource
* Detecting the n+1 queries problem in your Spring tests before having performance issues in production
* Avoiding performance regressions by adding an assert on the query count in your integration tests
* Improving the onboarding of new developers by showing them the impact of the n+1 queries problem



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* JDK 8 or more.  

### Installation
##### Maven

Add dependency to your project inside your `pom.xml` file
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yannbriancon</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-hibernate-query-count</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```


<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

Now that you added the dependency, you can instantiate a HibernateQueryCountInterceptor object and start to use it.

Three methods are available:
* startCounter: Initializes the query count to 0 and allows the queries to increment the count.
* getQueryCount: Returns the current query count for the Thread concerned as a Long.
* removeCounter: Removes the instance of the queryCount that is a ThreadLocal<Long> and stops the counting.

The count is local to a Thread. This choice was made to have a consistent count for a running application and avoid other threads to alter the count.

Example in a test:

```java
...
import com.yannbriancon.interceptor.HibernateQueryCountInterceptor;


@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@Transactional
public class FileUploadResourceIntTest {
    @Autowired
    private HibernateQueryCountInterceptor hibernateQueryCountInterceptor;

    @Test
    public void getFiles_isOk() throws Exception {
        // Initialize the query to 0 and allow the counting
        hibernateQueryCountInterceptor.startCounter();

        File file = new File();
        
        // The method saveAndFlush will force the query to be executed directly and trigger the count incrementation.
        // The method save would not force it.
        // We would need to wait the end of the transaction to be sure the query has been executed and the count updated.
        // see https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-jpa-save-saveandflush for more details
        fileRepository.saveAndFlush(file)

        // Get the query count for this thread and check that it is equal to 1
        Assertions.assertThat(hibernateQueryCountInterceptor.getQueryCount()).isEqualTo(1);
    }
}
```
